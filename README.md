# Diamond Price Prediction


Using python programming language ( libraries as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Sikit-learn, etc ... ) to analyze and build model able to predict the Diamond Price.



Project steps:

1-Discover Data :

→ Show the type of columns

→ Check if it contain NaNs

2- Visualization data :

→ Display outliers and correlation between input data 

→ Categorical attributes visualizations

→ Study each Feature to get useful insight

3- Prepare the data :

→ Data Cleaning

→ Handling Outliers

→ Handling Text and Categorical Attributes

→ Attribute Combinations

→ Feature Scaling

4- Modeling :

Such as (Linear regression - DecisionTree - RandomForest - LGBMRegressor - XGBRegressor - GradientBoosting - StackingRegressor - VotingRegressor )

→ Train the model then evaluate it Using Cross Validation

→ Fine Tune the model by GridSearchCV

→ Analyze the Best Model



After some experiments, we decided to use Random Forest Regressor algorithm which gave us the best possible results
